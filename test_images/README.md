# Test Images

This directory contains test images for the SizePredict application.

You can add your own reference images here to use with the Fixed Pose Mode feature.

## Using Fixed Pose Mode

1. Upload a clear, well-lit full-body photo
2. Click "Set Current Image as Reference" to use this image's pose points as reference
3. Toggle "Fixed Pose Mode" to ON
4. Now all subsequent images will use the same reference points for measurements

This ensures consistent measurements across different photos, as the pose points will always be in the same relative positions.
